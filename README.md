## Hi there 👋

I am Ahmed

I’m an **Electronic & Electrical Engineering** student at **UCL** and I’m building towards **FPGA / low-latency engineering (HFT-style)**.  
I like projects where you can measure performance properly: **throughput, latency (cycles), Fmax**, and resource trade-offs.

---

## What I’m currently working on
- **FPGA / RTL portfolio** focused on low-latency design patterns:
  - streaming pipelines, backpressure, FIFOs, arbitration
  - timing constraints + closing timing
  - CDC + reset strategy (the “real bugs live here” stuff)
- **sEMG Human–Machine Interface** (signal acquisition → analogue front-end → MCU → real-time output)
- **Sub-GHz wireless sensor network** project (link-quality-aware transmission)

---

## Tools I use
**Hardware / RTL**
- SystemVerilog / Verilog, testbenches, waveform debug
- Quartus Prime (and I’m building more reps with timing closure + constraints)

**Software**
- C / embedded (MCU work), basic Python for analysis/automation
- Git + GitHub (docs + reproducible builds)

---

If you’re working on **FPGA / low-latency / embedded**, I’m always down to connect.
